# AI-powered-Exercise-form-checker
1. Project Overview

This project uses your webcam, OpenCV, and MediaPipe Pose to analyze and provide real-time feedback on your form while performing dumbbell lateral raises.

The system:

Tracks arm movement and posture

Counts repetitions automatically

Provides form correction feedback (arm height, elbow straightness, shoulder relaxation, balance)

Displays milestone messages when you hit certain rep counts

üëâ Perfect for fitness enthusiasts, trainers, or anyone working out at home who wants instant feedback to improve technique.

3. Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV ‚Äì Webcam input and video frame display

MediaPipe Pose ‚Äì Real-time human pose estimation

NumPy ‚Äì Angle calculations and numeric operations

4. Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dumbbell-lateral-raise-tracker.git
cd dumbbell-lateral-raise-tracker

2. Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

3. Run the project
python lateral_raise_checker.py

5. Workflow & Usage

The script starts video capture from your webcam.

MediaPipe Pose detects key body landmarks in each frame.

The program calculates:

Shoulder-to-arm angles (to track lateral raises)

Elbow straightness

Neck/shoulder posture (to detect shrugging)

Balance between left and right arms

A rep counter increments only when both arms complete a raise together.

Milestone messages (e.g., ‚ÄúGood job! 10 reps!‚Äù) appear at specific counts.

Form feedback is shown directly on the live video:

"Raise left arm higher"

"Straighten right elbow"

"Relax shoulders down"

"Balance arm heights"

The overlay displays:

Rep count

Current stage (up or down)

Form feedback
